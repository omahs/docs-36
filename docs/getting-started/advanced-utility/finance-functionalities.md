# Finance functionalities

The current financial model for NFTs and digital assets is too one-dimensional: basically only buy or sell. <br />

NVM Finance Functionalities help you to develop more advanced revenue models and marketplaces. These are functionalities that allow you to implement Web3-compatible monetization into NFT and digital assets. We currently have 5 different utilities, all available via our [SDK](../../getting-started/). <br />
<br />

**Finance Utility 1 - Secondary Market Royalties**<br />

_What is it?_<br />
The user registering an asset can specify the royalties that are rewarding the original creator in the secondary market. These royalties must be between 0 and 100 percent. The royalties can not be changed after they are initialized. This protects the buyers of a NFT to have to pay for a different commission to the one agreed during the purchase of a NFT.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
We have seen many examples where the payout of royalties depends on the goodwill of a marketplace. With this functionality, the royalty conditions are ‘embedded’ in the NFT and will be executed upon.<br />

<br />

**Finance Utility 2 - Rewards**<br />

_What is it?_ <br />
A feature that allows you to use tokens, including your native token, to reward performance and behavior.<br />

_Why use this?_ <br />
This allows asset producers and content creators to recognize and reward the contributions made by other participants and to stimulate collaborative growth and creation.<br />

<br />

**Finance Utility 3 - Dynamic Pricing Framework**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
A feature that allows you to define on-chain and off-chain conditions that influence the price of your asset.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
This allows asset producers to go beyond the one-dimensional pricing strategies. The template comes with a curve model, but the framework allows devs to integrate their own dynamic pricing conditions, e.g. supply/demand, external oracle data,...<br />

**Finance Utility 4 - Marketplace Framework**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
A framework to create your own NFT Marketplace.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
Rather than build a marketplace from scratch, this allows you to manage all the typical metadata required to build a marketplace.<br />

Dig into [Specs](../../architecture/specs/Spec-MKT/#secondary-market) of the Marketplace API.<br />
<br />

**Finance Utility 5 - NFT Collateralization**<br />
_What is it?_<br />
An integration with the Aave protocol that allows NFT owners to deposit their tokens, in return for a loan.<br />

_Why use this?_<br />
This allows asset owners to monetize their assets in different ways, while maintaining ownership.<br />
